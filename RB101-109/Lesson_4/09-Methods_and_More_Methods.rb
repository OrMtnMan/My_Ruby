puts 'Practice Problem 1:'
puts 'The return value will be the array because hi is truthy.'
puts 'Because all are made truthy by the hi it returns the entire thing.'

puts 'Practice Problem 2:'
puts 'Check the ruby docs.'
puts 'It counts if the return value evals to true.'

puts 'Practice Problem 3:'
puts '#puts always returns a nil.'
puts 'So, because the puts is nil, it returns the entire array.'

puts 'Practice Problem 4:'
puts 'It would return a hash wherein the key is a string of the first letter of the word.'
puts 'That happens with the value[0].'

puts 'Practice Problem 5:'
puts 'Shift mutates and removes the first pair in the hash.'
puts 'Then it returns it as an array.'

puts 'Practice Problem 6:'
puts 'This would return the number of characters in the last item in the array.'
puts 'This is because first the .pop returns the value of the last item in the array.'
puts 'Then the #size is called on it which returns the number of characters.'

puts 'Practice Problem 7:'
puts 'The return value would be true.'
puts 'This is because the num.odd? id called at the end.'
puts 'It would only output 1 because it stops after finding the first true thing.'

puts 'Practice Problem 8:'
puts 'Always read the documentation!'
puts 'Take returns the specified number of items from an array in a new one.'
puts 'It is not destructive which can be tested in irb or a small .rb'

puts 'Practice Problem 9:'
puts 'Map will return an array.'
puts 'In this case, bear will be retained because it is over 3 characters.'
puts 'However, ant will become a nil because there is no return value if the value has less than or equal to 3 characters.'

puts 'Practice Problem 10:'
puts 'Like above it will return an array.'
puts 'In this case, all of the numbers greater than 1 will be nil.'
puts 'This is because, yet again, puts returns nil.'
